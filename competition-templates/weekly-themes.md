## Tips for Competition Organizers

### Weekly Competitions
- Rotate between easy and challenging themes
- Mix creative freedom with specific constraints
- Consider player skill levels

### Monthly Competitions
- Use more complex themes requiring detailed builds
- Allow larger plot sizes
- Consider team competitions

### Seasonal Events
- Align themes with real-world seasons/holidays
- Create special reward cosmetics
- Host community voting events

### Theme Selection Strategy
1. **Balance difficulty** - mix simple and complex
2. **Variety** - rotate categories (nature, fantasy, modern, etc.)
3. **Community input** - let players suggest themes
4. **Trending topics** - align with festas_builds content
5. **Skill levels** - have beginner-friendly weeks

### Making Themes More Specific
Instead of just "Castle", try:
- "A castle under siege"
- "A peaceful castle garden"
- "Ruined castle overtaken by nature"
- "Floating castle in the clouds"

This adds creative direction while maintaining freedom!
