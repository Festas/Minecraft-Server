# TODO for server admins:
# 1. Download SuperVanish from GitHub releases
# 2. Install plugin and restart server
# 3. Configure vanish settings in plugins/SuperVanish/config.yml
# 4. Grant permissions to creator rank via LuckPerms
# 5. Test vanish mode with a creator account
# 6. Set up logging for accountability
# 7. Document filming guidelines for creators
