# Notes
# - Starter kit is given once per player (first join only)
# - Rank kits are given automatically on rank-up
# - Competition kit is given when claiming a competition plot
# - All kits are EULA compliant (can be earned through gameplay)

# TODO for server admins:
# 1. Install EssentialsX or a kit plugin
# 2. Configure kits in the plugin's config
# 3. Test starter kit on first join
# 4. Adjust item quantities based on server economy
# 5. Set up automatic kit giving on rank-up
# 6. Consider weekly supporter kits (EULA compliant)
